## My process

I have started with developing the main overview of the page with CSS for the Desktop view. Once that was completed I started to move onto some logic as hovers/onClicks etc. Then I finally adjusted my CSS to make it work for the Mobile dimensions.

### Built with

- Desktop-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - Stylesheet language
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) - React Hooks

### What I learned

I have learned some more knowledge with Grid CSS, I also used SWR for the first time as I wanted to test that out. Furthermore I also learned some more TypeScript types related to Next.js
